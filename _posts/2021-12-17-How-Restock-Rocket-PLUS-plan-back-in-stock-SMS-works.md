Back in Stock SMS alerts achieve a 3x better conversion rate than traditional email alerts. Filemonk's PRO plan allows you to send UNLIMITED email alerts and charges you $0.1 per back in stock SMS alert sent. The PRO plan also entitles you to priority support and access to all new features that will be released.

Starting from the date you subscribe to the Plus plan, you get to send UNLIMITED back in stock emails and SMS alerts for $0.1 per SMS.

For example - If you signed up to Filemonk's PRO plan on Dec 12, then your billing cycles will be Dec 12 - Jan 11, Jan 12 - Feb 11 and so on. Let's say you had 100 SMS notifications from Dec 12 - Jan 11, you will be charged $10 ($0.1 X 100) in the same billing cycle in addition to the $15 recurring charge. If no SMS's are sent in a particular month, you will not be charged.

At Filemonk, I am dedicated to helping you succeed with your business. If you are not sure about the usage fee charged to your store or if you feel that you have been charged incorrectly, please let me know via the Customer Support widget within Filemonk or via email at <a href="mailto:support@filemonk.io">support@filemonk.io</a>. Rest assured that if there is any issue on my part, I'll make sure to issue a refund at the earliest.
